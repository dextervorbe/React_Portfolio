           As an avid gamer ðŸŽ® I was always interested in the world of code and wanted to know how it all worked ðŸ¤”. Being able to create mobile responsive web applications helped me gain a better understanding of code, and has turned into a passion of mine.
           As a âœ¨perfectionistâœ¨ I want to make sure my code is flawless. I enjoy working with groups of like-minded and knowledgeable individuals, where I can further surpass my skills as a developer.
